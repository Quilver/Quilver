Hello this is Quinte. I have been coding since I was 14. Here are some projects that I think represent my skills

1. Market simulator (This is a simulation that looks at determining the value of goods for the market)
2. AI chatbot (This is a chatbot with data science)
3. Papyrus Wars (This is a game I made)
4. 3D space sim (This shows skills in graphics programming)
